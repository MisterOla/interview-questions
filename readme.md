## Interview Quesions

From interviews that I've been through

> Most interviews involve questions that can be easily Googled. In most cases, they are areas that I take for granted and don't pay much attention to - e.g., How do you create a web form? "Why would I need to know this when I just copy and paste the syntax from Bootstrap?"

### Ruby

1. What's yield?
2. Talk about some design patterns you've used.
3. What's the difference between a module and class.
4. Most complocated algorithm you've worked on.

### SQL

1. What's an inner join?

### Python

1. How do you reverse a binary tree?

### Ugh

1. What is the difference between GET and POST? (dig deep)
2. What does the unix command uptime do?
3. Write a regex to match phone numbers in the following formats: (301)-000-0000 and 301.000.000 and 3010000000
4. Say you have a text file that looks like:
  
  ```
  date request number_of_requests other_field

  10-14-00 40000 some_other_field

  10-14-00 10000 some_other_field

  14-40-20000 20000 some_other_stuff
  ```

  The boss walks in and requests these logs to be sorted by number of request in descending order. How do you write this method and one to pretty-print it?

  Output should resemble:

  ```
  10-14-00 40000

  14-40-19 20000
  ```

5. Design an inventory management system. You should be able to add, find and delete an item.
6. 2 hours of TDDing a task-list
7. 3 hour challenge of implementing a blog that supported commenting
8. Describe hoisting in JavaScript.
9. What is the difference between inner joins and outer joins?
10. Write a function to find the middle node in a linked list?
11. Implement vanilla binary search
12. What could be slow about writing this `css#home a`
13. What is the difference between a class and a prototype in JavaScript?
14. What is a technical challenge you have recently faced? What did you do to plan your solution?
15. When would you git rebase instead of git merge
